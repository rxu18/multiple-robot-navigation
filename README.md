# multiple-robot-navigation
This repository contains code I wrote at Stamford in 2016. The code is for a camp focused on robot navigations. The camp was run by Qin Chen.

The most important files in src are "multi_grid_navi.py", which performs grid navigation in a tight space with multiple robots (imagine situations where the robots need to "make space for each other"); "auto-maze-solver.py", which allows the hamster to solve a somewhat complex maze automatically; "cpsace_navi.py", where a simulated robot navigate through a complex space; "trash_cleaner.py", where the robot moves trash out of a ring using a finite state machine as its brain.

This was the first time I ever wrote Python programs, so pardon my stylistic choices.
